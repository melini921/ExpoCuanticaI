\section{Density functional theory}

The Density Functional Theory (DFT) is an approximation used to compute the electronic structure of matter. It is applied to atoms, molecules, and solids, as well as quantum and classical fluids and nuclei.

DFT is based on two fundamental principles developed in the 1960s by physicists Pierre Hohenberg and Walter Kohn:  

\textbf{First Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem (HK):} 
This theorem states that all the fundamental properties of a many-electron system are uniquely determined by its ground-state electronic density, \(\rho(\mathbf{r})\). In other words, the electronic density uniquely defines the external potential of the system, and consequently, the total energy and all other properties of the system.

\textbf{ Second Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem:}  
This theorem introduces the concept of a functional, which is a function that depends on another function, in this case, the electronic density. It asserts that there exists a functional of the electronic density, \(F[\rho]\), that allows for the calculation of the total energy of the system. Furthermore, the ground state of the system corresponds to the minimum of this energy functional.

\subsection{Original Formulation}

DFT provides the ground-state properties of a system, with the electron density playing a central role. The goal of most approximations in solid-state physics and quantum chemistry is to solve the non-relativistic, time-independent Schrödinger equation, which involves a Hamiltonian for a system of \(M\) nuclei and \(N\) electrons. Using the coordinate representation \(\vec{R}_j\) for the nuclei with a charge \(eZ_i\) and \(\vec{r}_j\) for the electrons, the Hamiltonian is expressed as follows: 

\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber H=-\sum_i^N \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\nabla_i^2 -\sum_i^n \frac{\hbar^2}{2M_i}\nabla_i^2 +\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum _{i,j}^{n,N}\frac{e^2Z_j}{\left| \vec{R}_i-\vec{r}_j \right|} + \\
+ \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum _{j<i}^{N}\frac{e^2}{\left| \vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j \right|} +\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum _{j<i}^{n}\frac{e^2Z_iZ_j}{\left| \vec{R}_i-\vec{r}_j \right|}
\end{eqnarray}


To simplify the system, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is used. Due to the mass difference between nuclei and electrons, nuclei move much more slowly than electrons. This allows us to assume that electrons move in a field created by fixed nuclei. In this approximation, the nuclei's kinetic energy is negligible, and their potential energy is treated as a constant. Natural units are also employed, where the electron charge (\(e\)), the reduced Planck constant (\(\hbar\)), and the speed of light (\(c\)) are set to unity, further simplifying the expressions.

\begin{equation}
    H_{elec}=T+V_{Ne}+V_{ee}
\end{equation}

The solution to the Schrödinger equation with \(H_{elec}\) is the electronic wave function, \(\Psi_{elec}\), and the electronic energy, \(E_{elec}\). The total energy is the sum of the electronic energy and the nuclear repulsion constant, \(E_{nuc}\). 

\begin{equation}
    H_{elec}\Psi_{elec}=E_{elec}\Psi_{elec}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    E_{Tot}=E_{elec}+E_{nuc}, \quad \text{where } E_{nuc}=\sum_{j<i}^{n}\frac{Z_iZ_j}{\vec{R}_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Kohn-Sham Scheme}  

In 1965, Walter Kohn and Lu Sham developed the practical framework for implementing DFT, known as the Kohn-Sham scheme, which simplifies solving the many-body problem.

The electronic density (\(\rho(\mathbf{r})\)) is a three-dimensional function that describes the probability of finding electrons at different points in space. For a system with \(N\) electrons, it satisfies the following condition:

\begin{equation}
    \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) \, d\mathbf{r} = N
\end{equation}

The total energy of the system is expressed as a functional of the electronic density:

\begin{equation}
    E[\rho] = T[\rho] + V_\text{ext}[\rho] + V_\text{ee}[\rho]
\end{equation}

Here, \(T[\rho]\) represents the kinetic energy of the electrons, \(V_\text{ext}[\rho]\) is the potential energy due to the external potential, and \(V_\text{ee}[\rho]\) accounts for the electron-electron repulsion energy.

\section{Approximations to the Exchange-Correlation Functional}  

DFT incorporates an additional term, the exchange-correlation functional \(E_\text{xc}[\rho]\), which accounts for the more complex electronic interactions. The exact form of this functional is unknown, and the accuracy of the calculations depends on the choice of approximations, such as: \\

\textbf{LDA (Local Density Approximation):}   
This approximation models a system where electrons move in a positive background charge distribution, ensuring overall neutrality. The main idea behind LDA is the assumption that \(E_\text{xc}[\rho]\) can be expressed as:  

\begin{equation}
    E_{XC}^{LDA}[\rho] = \int \rho(\vec{r}) \epsilon_{XC}\big(\rho(\vec{r})\big) d\vec{r}
\end{equation}  

\textbf{GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation):} To go beyond the LDA and improve upon it, GGA incorporates not only information about the density \(\rho(\vec{r})\) at a specific point \(\vec{r}\), but also complements it with the gradient of the charge density, \(\nabla\rho(\vec{r})\), to account for the inhomogeneity of the electron density:  

\begin{equation}
    E_{XC}^{GGA}\left[ \rho_\alpha, \rho_\beta \right] = \int f\big( \rho_\alpha, \rho_\beta, \nabla\rho_\alpha, \nabla\rho_\beta \big) d\vec{r}
\end{equation}  

GGA improves upon LSD by considering spatial variations of the electronic density, providing greater accuracy in total energies, reaction barriers, and structural differences. \\ 

\textbf{Article Notation:} 

\begin{center}

\end{center}  

\begin{equation}
    E_{XC}^{LSD}[n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow] = \int d^3r \, n \, \epsilon_{XC}^{\text{unif}}(n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow)  
\end{equation}  
where \(n = n_\uparrow + n_\downarrow\) is the total electronic density, and \(\epsilon_{XC}^{\text{unif}}\) is the exchange-correlation energy per particle of a uniform electron gas.

\begin{equation}
    E_{XC}^{GGA}[n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow] = \int d^3r \, n \, \epsilon_{XC}^{\text{unif}}(n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow)  
\end{equation}  
where \(n = n_\uparrow + n_\downarrow\) is the total electronic density, and \(\epsilon_{XC}^{\text{unif}}\) is the exchange-correlation energy per particle of a uniform electron gas.

\section{Proposal for a New GGA}

\subsection{Problems with the PW91 Model}

The PW91 functional (Perdew-Wang, 1991) was a previous implementation of GGA, but it had several limitations. It relied on a complex parameterization of the functional \(f\), which introduced issues such as "spurious oscillations" in the exchange-correlation potential (\(V_{XC}\)), did not scale properly under high electronic density limits, and was computationally expensive due to its overparameterization.\\

The paper proposes a simplified new GGA functional that meets the most important conditions and eliminates the issues present in the PW91 model.

\subsection{Correlation Energy (\(E_C\)) in GGA}

In the new GGA, the correlation energy is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    E_C^{GGA}[n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow] = \int d^3r \, n \left[ \epsilon_C^{\text{unif}}(r_s, z) + H(r_s, z, t) \right],
\end{equation}

where: 
\(r_s = \left( \frac{3}{4 \pi n} \right)^{1/3}\) is the local Seitz radius,  
\(z = \frac{n_\uparrow - n_\downarrow}{n}\) is the relative spin polarization,  
\(t = \frac{|\nabla n|}{2k_F n}\) is a dimensionless gradient, with \(k_F = (3\pi^2 n)^{1/3}\) as the Fermi wave number, and  
\(H(r_s, z, t)\) is a gradient correction. \\


\(H(r_s, z, t)\) satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the limit of uniform density (\(t \to 0\)):  
    $$H \to b \, t^2, \quad b \approx 0.066725$$
    \item In the limit of rapidly varying density (\(t \to \infty\)):  
    $$H \to -\epsilon_C^{\text{unif}}$$  
    causing the correlation to vanish.
\end{enumerate}

The term \(H\) is parameterized as: 

 \begin{equation}
     H = \frac{e^2}{a_0} \, g \, \ln \left( 1 + \frac{b}{g} t^2 \right)
 \end{equation}

where \(g = (1 - \ln 2) / \pi^2 \) y \(a_0\) is the borh radius.

\subsection{Exchange Energy (\(E_X\)) in GGA}

The exchange term in GGA is described by:

\begin{equation}
    E_X^{GGA}[n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow] = \int d^3r \, n \, \epsilon_X^{\text{unif}}(n) F_X(s)
\end{equation}

where, \(\epsilon_X^{\text{unif}} = -\frac{3}{4} \left( \frac{3}{\pi} \right)^{1/3} e^2 n^{4/3}\) is the exchange energy of the uniform gas, \(F_X(s)\) is an enhancement factor dependent on the reduced gradient \(s = |\nabla n| / 2k_F n\). \\

The functional complies with the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the limit of uniform density (\(s \to 0\))
    $$ F_X(s) \to 1.$$
    \item At the high density boundary  (\(s \to \infty\)):
    $$ F_X(s) \leq 1.804$$
    meeting Lieb-Oxford's requirement.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Results:}  
The simplified new GGA reproduces results comparable to PW91, but with a cleaner and more efficient model. Atomization energy calculations for small molecules show that the proposed functional achieves similar accuracy to PW91, but with a simpler implementation.

\section{Conclusions}  

The GGA functional introduced in this work resolves the main limitations of the PW91 model by providing a simpler, more efficient, and robust formulation. By retaining the fundamental characteristics required for energy calculations, the proposed functional enhances its practical applicability in studies of molecular and solid systems, facilitating its implementation without compromising result accuracy.  \\

Compared to PW91, this new GGA eliminates issues such as spurious oscillations and incorrect behavior in high-density electronic limits. It ensures a more consistent treatment of density gradients and satisfies essential scaling and physical limit conditions. It delivers comparable accuracy in atomization energies with a significantly simpler computational implementation.  \\

The presented advancement not only represents a technical refinement of the GGA model but also reinforces the theoretical understanding of exchange and correlation terms in DFT. This simplified functional provides a more accessible and efficient tool for addressing challenges in solid-state physics, quantum chemistry, and related fields, facilitating its adoption in demanding calculations and complex material studies.
